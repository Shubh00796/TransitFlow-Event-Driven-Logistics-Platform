# ðŸš› TransitFlow: Event-Driven Logistics Platform

**TransitFlow** is a modular, event-driven logistics platform designed for **scalable**, **resilient**, and **decoupled** order-to-delivery workflows. Each service owns its domain and communicates asynchronously using **Kafka**, enabling robust and fault-tolerant operations across the supply chain.
